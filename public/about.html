<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently a second-year student at Chitkara University, pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. 
  Technology has always fascinated me, and diving deeper into programming, problem-solving, and innovation keeps me constantly engaged. 
  In my academic journey, I strive to be a diligent and curious learner, always eager to explore new concepts. While 
  I consider myself one of the brighter students in my class, I value humility and believe that knowledge grows best when shared. 
  Helping my peers whenever possible not only strengthens my understanding but also fosters a collaborative learning environment.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, sports play a huge role in my life. I enjoy an active lifestyle and love engaging in various sports, 
  including basketball, football, swimming, lawn tennis, table tennis, badminton, and cricket. The thrill of competition, 
  the teamwork involved, and the sheer joy of the game are things that drive me. Whether it’s the fast-paced action of football 
  or the strategic plays in tennis, I find fulfillment in constantly challenging myself and improving my skills. Sports teach me 
  resilience, discipline, and the importance of adaptability—lessons that translate well into every aspect of life.</p>

<p>Music and literature are also essential to me. As a pianist, I find solace and creativity in playing melodies that evoke 
  emotions beyond words. Music has a way of bringing clarity, relaxation, and inspiration, making it an integral part of my life. 
  Additionally, my love for reading allows me to explore different perspectives, worlds, and ideas, broadening my understanding of 
  the world. Whether it’s a gripping novel, insightful non-fiction, or thought-provoking articles, I enjoy immersing myself in stories 
  and concepts that challenge my thinking. Balancing my passions—technology, sports, music, and literature—keeps me energized and motivated 
  to continuously grow and evolve.</p>
